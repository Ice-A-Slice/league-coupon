# Test Fixing Roadmap

*Generated: 7/16/2025*

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive roadmap to achieve 100% test stability by fixing 25 failing tests across 4 root cause categories.

### Key Findings
- 20 tests (80%) fail due to Database Seeding Issues
- 20 quick wins identified for immediate impact
- 7 critical fix batches require immediate attention
- Single infrastructure fix could resolve majority of failures

### Expected Outcomes
- Increase test success rate from 94% to 100%
- Eliminate database seeding issues affecting multiple test suites
- Establish stable foundation for future development
- Reduce CI/CD pipeline failures and development friction
