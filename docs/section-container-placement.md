# SectionContainer Component Placement: UI vs Layout Folder

## Component Analysis

Looking at your `SectionContainer` component:

```tsx
// Key features of SectionContainer
interface SectionContainerProps {
  title: string;
  subtitle?: string;
  children: ReactNode;
  collapsible?: boolean;
  initialCollapsed?: boolean;
  onToggleVisibility?: () => void;
  footer?: ReactNode;
  className?: string;
  headerClassName?: string;
  footerClassName?: string;
}
```

This component:
- Provides a consistent container with header, content area, and optional footer
- Handles collapsible behavior
- Is used by multiple feature components (BettingCoupon and Questionnaire)
- Defines a structural pattern for sections in your application

## UI vs Layout Components

### UI Components
- Basic building blocks (buttons, inputs, badges, etc.)
- Focus on appearance and interaction
- Highly reusable across different contexts
- Usually don't dictate layout or structure
- Examples: Button, ToggleButton, Badge, Input

### Layout Components
- Define structure, positioning, and organization
- Create consistent patterns for content arrangement
- Often contain other components
- Examples: Container, Grid, Section, Card, Sidebar

## Recommendation

**SectionContainer is better suited for a layout folder** for these reasons:

1. **Primary Purpose**: It's primarily about structure and organization rather than a basic UI element
2. **Composition**: It composes other elements into a structural pattern
3. **Semantic Role**: It represents a layout concept (a section) rather than a UI control
4. **Usage Pattern**: It's used to structure different types of content across features

## Implementation Options

### Option 1: Create a dedicated layout folder
```
src/components/
├── layout/
│   ├── SectionContainer.tsx
│   └── index.ts
├── ui/
│   ├── button.tsx
│   └── ...
```

### Option 2: Create a sections subfolder in the UI folder
```
src/components/
├── ui/
│   ├── button.tsx
│   ├── sections/
│   │   └── SectionContainer.tsx
│   └── ...
```

## Recommendation

**Option 1 is preferred** because:
- It creates a clearer separation of concerns
- It allows for adding more layout components in the future
- It better represents the component's purpose
- It follows common React project organization patterns

This approach will make your codebase more intuitive and maintainable as it grows.
