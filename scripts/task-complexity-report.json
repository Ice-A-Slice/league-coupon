      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Dynamic Round Identification Logic",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of a reusable function that identifies the current betting round by querying the fixtures table for the earliest 'NS' status fixture in the active season. Include subtasks for query design, error handling for no upcoming fixtures, code modularization, unit testing, and documentation.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves database querying, control flow for edge cases, and ensuring reusability. While the logic is straightforward, careful handling of edge cases and integration across the application increases its complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Create Background Data Synchronization Process",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "List the steps to implement a scheduled background job that fetches fixture data from an external API, compares and updates local records, handles API errors, and logs synchronization activity. Include subtasks for scheduling, API integration, data comparison logic, update operations, error handling, and logging.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires integrating with an external API, handling data synchronization, managing scheduling, and robust error handling. The need for reliability and idempotency, along with external dependencies, adds significant complexity."

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Modify Fixtures Display for Current Betting Round",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps to update the UI to display only fixtures from the current betting round with 'NS' status. Include subtasks for updating the data retrieval query, modifying UI components, ensuring round indication in the UI, and testing the display logic.",
      "reasoning": "This is a typical UI filtering and display update task, with moderate complexity due to dependency on dynamic round identification and possible query changes."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Betting Deadline Logic",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of betting deadline logic based on the earliest kickoff time in the current round. Include subtasks for server-side validation, client-side UI updates (form locking and countdown), timezone handling, integration with round logic, and comprehensive testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires synchronizing server and client logic, handling timezones, and ensuring robust validation. The need for both backend and frontend changes increases complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Add Rounds Table and Schema Updates",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "List the steps to create or update the database schema for round tracking, including creating the rounds table, updating fixtures and user_bets tables, and writing migration scripts.",
      "reasoning": "Schema changes are standard but require careful planning to avoid data integrity issues. The complexity is moderate due to the need for migrations and possible data backfills."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Basic Scoring Logic",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps to implement a scoring function that awards points for correct predictions. Include subtasks for defining scoring rules, implementing the calculation logic, updating user_bets, ensuring idempotency, and writing tests.",
      "reasoning": "While the scoring rules are simple, ensuring idempotency and correct integration with user data adds some complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Round Completion Detection",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of logic to detect round completion and trigger scoring. Include subtasks for checking fixture statuses, triggering scoring, updating round metadata, handling edge cases, and testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves monitoring state across multiple fixtures, triggering downstream processes, and updating metadata, which increases its complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Create Standings Calculation Logic",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "List the steps to implement user standings calculation based on accumulated points. Include subtasks for aggregating points, handling ties, sorting users, and testing the calculation logic.",
      "reasoning": "The logic is straightforward aggregation and sorting, with minor complexity added by tie handling."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Create Standings Page UI",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps to develop a minimal, responsive standings page. Include subtasks for creating the route, designing the table UI, integrating standings data, and ensuring accessibility.",
      "reasoning": "This is a standard UI rendering task with low complexity, focused on displaying pre-calculated data."
    },

      "taskId": 10,
      "taskTitle": "Integrate and Test Complete Workflow",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the integration and testing of the end-to-end workflow, including connecting all components, running integration tests with realistic data, monitoring process flow, and logging. Include subtasks for integration, scenario testing, bug fixing, and documentation.",
      "reasoning": "End-to-end integration and testing is inherently complex due to the need to coordinate multiple components, handle edge cases, and ensure system reliability."
