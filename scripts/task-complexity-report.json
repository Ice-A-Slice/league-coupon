    {
      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Define Zod Schema for Selections Type",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the process of creating a Zod schema for the Selections type into specific implementation steps, including file creation, schema definition, type validation for match selections ('1', 'X', '2'), and type inference setup.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating a new schema file with moderate complexity. The developer needs to understand Zod's dynamic key validation and implement proper type inference, but the requirements are well-defined and the schema structure is relatively straightforward."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement BettingCoupon Validation Function",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps to implement the validateSelections function, including how to integrate the Zod schema, structure the validation result object, handle error mapping, and integrate this function within the BettingCoupon component.",
      "reasoning": "This task builds on task 1 and requires implementing validation logic that returns structured error information. It involves understanding how to use Zod's safeParse method and organizing validation results in a specific format, with moderate complexity in error handling."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Define Zod Schema for Prediction Type",
      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the creation of the Prediction type Zod schema into steps covering file setup, defining validators for each required field (leagueWinner, lastPlace, bestGoalDifference, topScorer), implementing non-null validation, and setting up type inference.",
      "reasoning": "Similar to task 1 but slightly simpler as it involves standard object validation without dynamic keys. The schema needs to validate that specific fields have non-null values, which is a straightforward use of Zod."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Refactor Questionnaire Validation Function",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps to refactor the existing validatePredictions function, including analyzing the current implementation, integrating the new Zod schema, maintaining the current return value structure, and ensuring the ref implementation continues to work correctly.",
      "reasoning": "This refactoring task requires understanding an existing validation function and replacing it with Zod-based validation while preserving its interface. The complexity comes from ensuring backward compatibility with the current error state management and ref implementation."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Expose BettingCoupon Validation via Ref",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of the ref-based validation exposure in BettingCoupon into steps covering useImperativeHandle setup, defining the ref interface, implementing the validate method, ensuring proper typing, and testing the ref accessibility from parent components.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves React's useImperativeHandle hook which has moderate complexity. The developer needs to define a proper ref interface, implement the validation method, and ensure it's correctly exposed to parent components, requiring good understanding of React's ref system."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Update Page-Level Submission Validation",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps to update the page-level handleSubmit function, including accessing both component refs, implementing sequential or parallel validation, aggregating validation errors from both components, updating the submission logic, and handling the display of combined errors.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires coordinating validation across multiple components and aggregating their results. The complexity comes from managing refs to both components, determining when submission should proceed, and combining error information from different sources."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Error Display for BettingCoupon",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of error display in BettingCoupon into steps covering error state management, UI updates for highlighting invalid selections, creating error message components, styling the error indicators, and ensuring accessibility of error messages.",
      "reasoning": "This UI enhancement task requires adding error state management and updating the component to visually indicate validation errors. The complexity involves designing an intuitive error display that fits with the existing UI while clearly communicating validation issues."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Enhance Page-Level Error Display",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps to enhance the page-level error display, including designing the aggregated error UI, categorizing errors by component, implementing visual indicators for different error types, ensuring clear user guidance, and maintaining accessibility standards.",
      "reasoning": "This task builds on task 6 and focuses on improving how aggregated errors are displayed. The complexity involves organizing errors from multiple sources in a user-friendly way and designing clear visual indicators that guide users to fix issues."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Real-Time Validation Feedback",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of real-time validation feedback into steps covering event handling for user interactions, debouncing validation calls, updating validation timing in both components, designing and implementing real-time visual indicators, and ensuring performance optimization.",
      "reasoning": "This enhancement has higher complexity as it requires modifying when validation occurs in both components. The developer needs to implement event handlers, possibly debounce validation calls for performance, and design real-time visual feedback that doesn't disrupt the user experience."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 10,
      "taskTitle": "Write Integration Tests for Validation Flow",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps to create comprehensive integration tests, including setting up the testing environment, defining test scenarios for different validation states, mocking component interactions, implementing assertions for validation behavior, testing error displays, verifying submission logic, and ensuring test coverage.",
      "reasoning": "Integration testing is inherently complex, especially for validation flows across multiple components. This task requires setting up test scenarios that cover various validation states, mocking component interactions, and verifying both the validation logic and UI feedback, demanding significant testing expertise."
