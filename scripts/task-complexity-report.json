      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of comprehensive error handling in the round management service into 5 specific subtasks, focusing on error categorization, transaction management, logging implementation, edge case handling, and testing strategies.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves reviewing and enhancing error handling across an entire service, requiring understanding of the existing codebase, implementing transactions, creating error types, and handling various edge cases. The complexity is moderate to high due to the need for comprehensive coverage and the technical depth required for proper error management."

      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the creation of a comprehensive test suite for the round management service into 6 concrete subtasks, addressing unit testing, integration testing, mock data preparation, edge case testing, documentation, and test automation setup.",
      "reasoning": "Creating a comprehensive test suite requires deep understanding of the service functionality, designing test cases for multiple scenarios, setting up mocking infrastructure, and handling complex edge cases like timezone issues. The complexity is high due to the breadth of testing required and the technical knowledge needed to properly test all aspects of the service."

      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of the betting round completion detection and scoring system into 7 detailed subtasks covering the round completion detector, scoring algorithm, database transaction management, scheduling mechanism, error handling and recovery, admin interface, and system testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves building a complex system with multiple components that need to work together seamlessly. It requires implementing detection logic, scoring algorithms, scheduled jobs, transaction management, and error recovery mechanisms. The high complexity stems from the need for data consistency, idempotent operations, and handling various edge cases across multiple interconnected components."
