# Task ID: 8
# Title: Create Standings Calculation Logic
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the logic to calculate user rankings based on accumulated points.
# Details:
Develop a function that calculates total points for each user by summing points_awarded from user_bets grouped by user_id. Sort users by total points in descending order to determine rankings. Handle ties by giving users with the same points the same rank.

# Test Strategy:
Test with mock user_bets data to verify correct point summation and ranking. Include edge cases like ties and users with no points.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Aggregate Total Points Per User [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement logic to calculate the total points for each user by summing the points_awarded from user_bets, grouped by user_id.
### Details:
Query the user_bets data source and group entries by user_id. For each user, sum the points_awarded field to compute their total points. Ensure the aggregation is efficient and handles cases where users have no bets (should result in zero points).

## 2. Sort Users by Total Points [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Sort the list of users in descending order based on their total points to establish the initial ranking order.
### Details:
Take the aggregated user-point data and sort it so that users with higher total points appear before those with fewer points. Ensure the sorting is stable to maintain consistent ordering for users with equal points.

## 3. Assign Ranks with Tie Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Assign ranks to users based on their sorted position, ensuring that users with the same total points receive the same rank and subsequent ranks are adjusted accordingly.
### Details:
Iterate through the sorted user list and assign ranks. If two or more users have the same total points, assign them the same rank. The next user after a tie should receive a rank that accounts for the number of users tied above (e.g., if two users are tied for rank 1, the next user is rank 3).

## 4. Package and Return Standings Data [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Format the ranked user data into the required output structure for downstream use or display.
### Details:
Prepare the final standings as an array or object, including user_id, total_points, and assigned rank for each user. Ensure the output is suitable for integration with other components, such as APIs or UI rendering.
