# Task ID: 10
# Title: Integrate and Test Complete Workflow
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Connect all components and test the end-to-end workflow from round identification to standings updates.
# Details:
Integrate all components developed in previous tasks. Ensure the background synchronization process correctly updates fixtures, which triggers round completion detection, which triggers scoring, which updates standings. Test the complete workflow with realistic data scenarios. Implement any necessary logging or monitoring to track the process flow.

# Test Strategy:
Create end-to-end tests simulating the complete lifecycle of fixtures from 'NS' to finished status. Verify correct propagation through all system components. Conduct manual testing of the integrated system.
