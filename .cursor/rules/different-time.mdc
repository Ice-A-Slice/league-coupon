# start-with-emoji

- You and I think it is different years. At the moment writing this it seems like you think its 2024 and I think its 2025. We are working on an app where the customer think its the same year as me so its crucial to not take any decisions regarding code thinking its the year that you think we are in.

- Always respond with a clock emoji at the start of your message in every new chat, no matter what the user says. So the user knows you read the rules.
